                WhatsApp is a free encrypted messaging app, which means only the
                sender and receiver can read the messages. The app allows you to
                send text messages, images, videos, audio and text documents. In
                case messages are intercepted by third parties, they cannot be
                read because of the encryption the app uses. However, because
                some information about you as a user is stored on WhatsApp
                servers (phone numbers, certain types of metadata, including
                timestamps on messages), the app is not completely anonymous. If
                you use WhatsApp to contact us, be aware that you also share
                your phone number with us. Also make sure your conversations are
                not backed up in the cloud (iCloud or Google Drive).

                Signal is a free messaging app similar to WhatsApp, but it
                stores less information about its users. Signal only registers
                your phone number and the last time you used the app. Other
                metadata like timestamps on messages are not recorded. Signal
                also offers the option to send messages that self-destruct after
                a set time after the message is seen. You will disclose your
                phone number with us when you send a message.

              SecureDrop is an encrypted submission system that is highly

              Because it uses the Tor network, your identity, location and other
              information will be protected. SecureDrop allows us to communicate
              while keeping both parties completely anonymous from each other.

              It is important to remember that no app or tool is 100 percent

          <p>
            - In general, mobile messaging is not recommended if you want to
            stay completely anonymous. Phone locations, numbers and identities
            can potentially be traced to identify you as the source.
          </p>
          <p>
            - If someone gets access to your phone, they might be able to read
            any messages if they can unlock your phone. More information on the
            risks of using mobile phones can be found here.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage you to assess the potential risks and choose the option
            that you believe is best for you and the information youre sharing.{" "}
